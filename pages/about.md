I'm some guy, struggling with this beast we call life. My hobbies mostly involve computers, social trends, electronic music, and psychology. I spend way too much time on reddit and video games, and I tend to hack away at whatever GNU/Linux system I have installed at any given time. 

I've also been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (colloquially known as depression), and this blog is partly my version of a personal journal. My current medication schedule is Bupropion, 300mg (morning) + 100mg (evening), ritalin as needed, and a vitamin regimen daily.

My computer is an aging Toshiba laptop, dual-booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04. The blog is currently [Ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/ "Ruhoh blog engine"), though I'm capricious and that could change at any time. My writing implement varies, but right now I'm giving [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) a shot. I'm in the indefinite free trial right now, but if I like it, and if I get enough money, I definitely plan on purchasing it. I like supporting good software.
