So, this is around the tenth time I've tried to start a blog, and as far as I know it's going to go just as spectacularly. I'm sure I've left traces of myself scattered across the internet, rogue bloggers and wordpresses with a single post to their credit. This one's a bit different though, since I actually have a purpose behind it.

Usually my attempts go something like this:

> Oh, you know what, I'm pretty good with computers. Maybe I'll make a blog about technology, programming, and all this stuff that I do in my free time!

Inevitably, this is a disaster, and I realize that I don't actually know jack shit about programming. This leads to me forgetting about the blog within a week.

Like I said though, this one's a bit different. I've been in therapy for depression for a while now, and I've heard a lot of people say that having a diary or journal helps them deal with the day-to-day of it all. I'm a huge geek, so I decided that instead of a paper journal I'd spin up a little blog for that purpose. Get my thoughts down in text, and air it for the world to see. Kind of nice to get things off my chest.

So, hopefully this will go better than my previous attempts. I'm going to make a few posts today to get myself started, and then put writing into my schedule, and hopefully actually stick to it. I know it's unlikely that anyone but me will actually be reading this, but if you are, welcome. Some of this might be interesting, lots of it might be depressing. But I hope it's valuable to someone out there.
