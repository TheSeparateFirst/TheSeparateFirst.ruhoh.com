So, the past few days I've been noticing another depressive mood coming on. It's subtle. I've been eating less, haven't seen my friends in too long, haven't gone outside in a while... But part of me is afraid it's too late to turn away from the spiral right now.

Depression is a funny beast. The scary part about it, to me, is that it makes me want to be _more_ depressed. This inevitably leads to a nasty depressive spiral like this one, in which being depressed makes me do things that make me more depressed, which makes me do things that make me more depressed, etc., etc., ad infinitum.

I still haven't really found a fix for this, at least for me. Once I hit a depressive mood, I tend to shut out the rest of the world, hole up in my room, and not eat much of anything for a few days. Once I've reached the point of recognizing my mood, I can't remember what it was ever like to feel genuinely happy. I can't see any reason to get out of my depression, because how could there be anything else? Life sucks, my room sucks, this food sucks, my skills suck, my girlfriend sucks, I suck. I'm never going to get a decent job, graduate college, or do anything that makes a person successful in life. I'm going to grow old and miserable at an increasing rate.

Of course (as I like to tell myself), none of these things are true. Life is at least passable, my room is just a little messy, food is awesome (Seriously, how do I get that one?), I'm doing pretty okay on the skill front, my girlfriend is great (For now, such is the life of a 20-something), and I'm a decent guy all told. But as much as I try to tell myself all of that, once I'm in a mood I can never believe it. I'm more like a stone statue than a human being. Unmoving, unproductive, silent, with no will to change anything. All I want to do is hide until everything goes away forever.

That doesn't last forever, though. Or at least it hasn't done so far. I always come out of those moods, and actually get to act like a normal person for a while. I have great friends who really like me, and a girlfriend who does the same. Despite my paranoia about everyone hating me, I consciously know that they really do like me. When I'm doing well, I can't imagine why I was so down for so long. It all seems so trivial, and I tell everyone to just ignore the things I say when I'm in a mood like that. I'm happy, social, friendly, active, and usually my social life keeps me propped up there for a good long while.

I don't know, maybe I've been mis-diagnosed. Maybe I've got some kind of bipolar disorder, or maybe I'm just kind of fucked in the head. Whatever the case may be, I just have to try and get through it, even though I usually just want to give up and collapse into hiding again. We'll see how the next few weeks are.
